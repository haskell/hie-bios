# hie-bios

`hie-bios` is the way to specify how
[`hie`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-ide-engine) and
[`ghcide`](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide) sets up a GHC API session.

Given a Haskell project that is managed by Stack, Cabal, or other package tools,
`hie` needs to know the full set of flags to pass to GHC in order to build the
project. `hie-bios` satisfies this need.

Its design is motivated by the guiding principle:

> It is the responsibility of the build tool to describe the environment
> which a package should be built in.

Using this principle, it is possible
to easily support a wide range of tools including `cabal-install`, `stack`,
`rules_haskell`, `hadrian` and `obelisk` without major contortions.
`hie-bios` does not depend on the `Cabal` library nor does not
read any complicated build products and so on.

How does a tool specify a session? A session is fully specified by a set of
standard GHC flags. Most tools already produce this information if they support
a `repl` command. Launching a repl is achieved by calling `ghci` with the
right flags to specify the package database. `hie-bios` needs a way to get
these flags and then it can set up GHC API session correctly.

Futher it means that any failure to set up the API session is the responsibility
of the build tool. It is up to them to provide the correct information if they
want the tool to work correctly.

## Explicit Configuration

The user can place a `hie.yaml` file in the root of the workspace which
describes how to setup the environment. For example, to explicitly state
that you want to use `stack` then the configuration file would look like:

```yaml
cradle: {stack: {component: "haskell-ide-engine:lib" }}
```

While the component is optional, this is recommended to make sure the correct
component is loaded.

To use `cabal`, the explicit configuration looks similar.
Note that `cabal` and `stack` have different way of specifying their
components.

```yaml
cradle: {cabal: {component: "lib:haskell-ide-engine"}}
```

Alternatively you can explicitly state a program or shell command which should
be used to collect the options.

The path of the `program` attribute is interpreted relative to the current
working directory if it isn't absolute. A program is passed the file to
return options for as its first argument, and a shell command will have it
available in the `HIE_BIOS_ARG` environment variable.

The process must consult the `HIE_BIOS_OUTPUT` environment variable and write a
list of options to this file separated by newlines. Once the process finishes
running, `hie-bios` reads this file and uses the arguments to set up the GHC
session. This is how GHC's build system is able to support `hie-bios`.

```yaml
cradle: {bios: {program: ".hie-bios"}}
```
```yaml
cradle: {bios: {shell: "build-tool flags $HIE_BIOS_ARG"}}
```

The `direct` cradle allows you to specify exactly the GHC options that should be used to load
a project. This is good for debugging but not a very good approach in general as the set of options
will quickly get out of sync with a cabal file.

```yaml
cradle: {direct: { arguments: [arg1, arg2]} }
```

The `none` cradle says that the IDE shouldn't even try to load the project. It
is most useful when combined with the multi-cradle which is specified in the next section.

```yaml
cradle: {none: }
```

## Multi-Cradle

For a multi-component project you can use the multi-cradle to specify how each
subdirectory of the project should be handled by the IDE.

The multi-cradle is a list of relative paths and cradle configurations.
The path is relative to the configuration file and specifies the scope of
the cradle. For example, this configuration specificies that files in the
`src` subdirectory should be handled with the `lib:hie-bios` component and
files in the `test` directory using the `test` component.

```yaml
cradle:
  multi:
    - path: "./src"
      config: { cradle: {cabal: {component: "lib:hie-bios"}} }
    - path: "./test"
      config: { cradle: {cabal: {component: "test"}} }
```

If a file matches multiple prefixes, the most specific one is chosen.
Once a prefix is matched, the selected cradle is used to find the options. This
is usually a specific cradle such as `cabal` or `stack` but it could be another
multi-cradle, in which case, matching works in exactly the same way until a
specific cradle is chosen.

This cradle type is experimental and may not be supported correctly by
some libraries which use `hie-bios`. It requires some additional care to
correctly manage multiple components.

Note: Remember you can use the multi-cradle to declare that certain directories
shouldn't be loaded by an IDE, in conjunction with the `none` cradle.

```yaml
cradle:
  multi:
    - path: "./src"
      config: { cradle: {cabal: {component: "lib:hie-bios"}} }
    - path: "./test"
      config: { cradle: {cabal: {component: "test"}} }
    - path: "./test/test-files"
      config: { cradle: { none: } }
```

For cabal and stack projects there is a shorthand to specify how to load each component.

```yaml
cradle:
  cabal:
    - path: "./src"
      component: "lib:hie-bios"
    - path: "./test"
      component: "test:bios-tests"
```

```yaml
cradle:
  stack:
    - path: "./src"
      component: "hie-bios:lib"
    - path: "./test"
      component: "hie-bios:test:bios-tests"
```

Remember you can combine this shorthand with more complicated configuration
as well.

```yaml
cradle:
  multi:
    - path: "./test/testdata"
      config: { cradle: { none:  } }
    - path: "./"
      config: { cradle: { cabal:
                            [ { path: "./src", component: "lib:hie-bios" }
                            , { path: "./tests", component: "parser-tests" } ] } }
```

### Cradle Dependencies

Sometimes it is necessary to reload a component, for example when a package
dependency is added to the project. Each type of cradle defines a list of
files that might cause an existing cradle to no longer provide accurate
diagnostics if changed. These are expected to be relative to the root of
the cradle.

This makes it possible to watch for changes to these files and reload the
cradle appropiately.
However, if there are files that are not covered by
the cradle dependency resolution, you can add these files explicitly to
`hie.yaml`.
These files are not required to actually exist, since it can be useful
to know when these files are created, e.g. if there was no `cabal.project`
in the project before and now there is, it might change how a file in the
project is compiled.

Here's an example of how you would add cradle dependencies that may not be covered
by the `cabal` cradle.

```yaml
cradle:
  cabal:
    component: "lib:hie-bios"

dependencies:
  - package.yaml
  - shell.nix
  - default.nix
```

For the `Bios` cradle type, there is an optional field to specify a program
or shell command to obtain cradle dependencies from:

```yaml
cradle:
  bios:
    program: ./flags.sh
    dependency-program: ./dependency.sh
```
```yaml
cradle:
  bios:
    shell: build-tool flags $HIE_BIOS_ARG
    dependency-shell: build-tool dependencies
```

The dependency program or command is executed with no parameters and it is
expected to output on stdout on each line exactly one filepath relative
to the root of the cradle, not relative to the location of the program.

Programs and shell commands for flags and dependencies can be mixed and matched.

## Configuration specification

The complete configuration is a subset of

```yaml
cradle:
  cabal:
    component: "optional component name"
  stack:
    component: "optional component name"
  bios:
    program: "program to run"
    dependency-program: "optional program to run"
  direct:
    arguments: ["list","of","ghc","arguments"]
  none:
  multi: - path: ./
           config: { cradle: ... }

dependencies:
  - someDep
```

## Testing your configuration

The provided `hie-bios` executable is provided to test your configuration.

The `flags` command will print out the options that `hie-bios` thinks you will need to load a file.

```
hie-bios flags exe/Main.hs
```

The `check` command will try to use these flags to load the module into the GHC API.

```
hie-bios check exe/Main.hs
```

## Implicit Configuration

There are several built in modes which captures most common Haskell development
scenarios. If no `hie.yaml` configuration file is found then an implicit
configuration is searched for. It is strongly recommended to just explicitly
configure your project.

### Priority

The targets are searched for in following order.

1. A specific `hie-bios` file.
2. A `stack` project
3. A `cabal` project
4. The direct cradle which has no specific options.

### `cabal-install`

The workspace root is the first folder containing a `cabal.project` file.

The arguments are collected by running `cabal v2-repl`.

If `cabal v2-repl` fails, then the user needs to configure the correct
target to use by writing a `hie.yaml` file.

### `stack`

The workspace root is the first folder containing a `stack.yaml` file.

The arguments are collected by executing `stack repl`.

### `bios`

The most general form is the `bios` mode which allows a user to specify themselves
which flags to provide.

In this mode, an executable file called `.hie-bios` is placed in the root
of the workspace directory. The script takes one argument, the filepath
to the current file we want to load into the session. The script returns
a list of GHC arguments separated by newlines which will setup the correct session.

A good guiding specification for this file is that the following command
should work for any file in your project.

```
ghci $(./.hie-bios /path/to/foo.hs | tr '\n' ' ') /path/to/foo.hs
```

This is useful if you are designing a new build system or the other modes
fail to setup the correct session for some reason. For example, this is
how hadrian (GHC's build system) is integrated into `hie-bios`.

## Supporting Bazel and Obelisk

In previous versions of `hie-bios` there was also support for projects using `rules_haskell` and `obelisk`.
This was removed in the 0.3 release as they were unused and broken. There is no conceptual barrier to adding
back support but it requires a user of these two approaches to maintain them.
